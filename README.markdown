# PPE Detection System Using YOLO

## Project Overview

The **PPE Detection System** is a deep learning-based solution designed for detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) in images using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. This project leverages machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, and integrates cloud tools like Azure for scalable, real-time deployment. The system is built to classify images and detect PPE objects, contributing to safety monitoring in industries such as construction, healthcare, and manufacturing.

The project follows a structured pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and continuous monitoring, as outlined in the project documentation.

## Installation

To run the PPE Detection System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mhany7/PPE-Detection-YOLO.git
   cd PPE-Detection-YOLO
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Models**: Download the pre-trained YOLO model weights and place them in the `models/` directory (instructions in the repository).
