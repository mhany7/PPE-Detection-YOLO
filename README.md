# SafeScan-YOLO
A Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) compliance monitoring system using YOLOv11 and the SH17 dataset.

## Project Overview
SafeScan-YOLO is a deep learning-based solution designed to monitor compliance with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage in industrial and workplace environments. Leveraging the YOLOv11 object detection model and the SH17 dataset, this system detects PPE items (e.g., helmets, masks, safety vests) in real-time, ensuring safety standards are met. The project spans data preprocessing, model training, optimization, and deployment, with potential integration into cloud platforms like Azure for scalable, real-time applications.

## Objectives
- Develop an object detection system to identify PPE items in images and video streams.
- Ensure accurate detection and classification of PPE compliance.
- Optimize the system for real-time performance in safety-critical settings.
- Deploy a user-friendly interface for monitoring PPE usage.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language (libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Albumentations).
- **Deep Learning**: YOLOv11 for object detection.
- **Dataset**: SH17 Dataset for PPE Detection (8,099 images, 17 classes).
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for preprocessing and visualization.
- **Cloud (Optional)**: Microsoft Azure for deployment and scalability.
- **GitHub**: Repository management and collaboration.
